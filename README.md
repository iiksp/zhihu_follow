this is a chrome extension, aim to copy the follow list of someone in [zhihu](www.zhihu.com). It just traverse the target people's follow list, and click the button.

the default interval is 2 minute

> followInterval = 1000 * 60 * 2;

which you can change in the file 'main.js'.

sorry for lacking money to buy a chrome developer( $ 5 ), so it have to be use in this geek way, if you would like to maintain it and post onto chrome extension page, I would appreciate that.

also sorry for my lazy, yet not having a GUI to change interval.



anyway, usage:

- download this zip from github, install the chrome extension in develop mode.( it is easy, just google for help.)

- go to target people's page [eg.](https://www.zhihu.com/people/gcxue-qiu-tu/following)ï¼Œ
> https://www.zhihu.com/people/gcxue-qiu-tu/following

- click the button
